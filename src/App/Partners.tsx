        Ever since the birth of blockchain technology, there has been an
        indelible connection between it and the desire for life extension â€” all
        the way back to the early cypherpunks and cryptocurrency founders such
        as Hal Finney, forward to the pioneers of the present such as Vitalik
        Buterin. You can be part of this grand tradition of transcending
        boundaries - be they financial or biological - in the service of all
        humankind.
